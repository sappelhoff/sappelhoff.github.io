Stefan Appelhoff
================

Hi, I am Stefan.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in cognitive neuroscience at the
`Max Planck Institute for Human Development <https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/staff/stefan-appelhoff>`_
in Berlin.
I work on questions like:


* How do humans search for information before making a value based choice?
* When do they decide to stop gathering additional information?
* How is active information accumulation different from passive information
  accumulation?

Next to figuring out these questions, I am a maintainer of the
`Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) <https://bids.neuroimaging.io>`_\ , at
the `Center for Reproducible Neuroscience <https://reproducibility.stanford.edu/>`_
at Stanford University.
BIDS is an emerging standard for the organization and documentation of neuroimaging
data. BIDS will help making neuroscience more reproducible by facilitating
(re)use, sanity-checking, and sharing of scientific data.

I am also interested in more technical problems, such as how to accurately mark events in an experiment using consumer grade hardware (`https://sappelhoff.github.io/usb-to-ttl <https://sappelhoff.github.io/usb-to-ttl>`_)

Finally, I am a strong proponent of open source software and contribute to
several software packages such as:


* `MNE-Python <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python>`_
* `MNE-BIDS <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids>`_
* `BIDS-validator <https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator>`_
