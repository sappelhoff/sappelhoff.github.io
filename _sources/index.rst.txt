Dr. Stefan Appelhoff
====================

Hi, I am Stefan |:wave:|

I am a senior biosignal data analyst at
`Zander Labs <https://www.zanderlabs.com>`_.

I am also a maintainer of the
`Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) <https://bids.neuroimaging.io>`_\.
BIDS is an emerging standard for the organization and documentation of neuroimaging data.
BIDS will help making neuroscience more reproducible by facilitating
(re)use, sanity-checking, and sharing of scientific data.

I am also interested in more technical problems, such as how to accurately mark events in an experiment using consumer grade hardware (`https://sappelhoff.github.io/usb-to-ttl <https://sappelhoff.github.io/usb-to-ttl>`_)

Finally, I am a strong proponent of open source software and contribute to
several software packages such as `MNE-Python <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python>`_.

If you want to know more, or collaborate on an interesting topic, please get in
touch under [my first name] [dot] [my last name] [at] mailbox [dot] org.
